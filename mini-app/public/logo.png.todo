A stylized, modern logo featuring a stylized wallet icon in the center, surrounded by three interconnected circles representing Base, BSC, and Ethereum blockchains. The wallet icon is a simple outline of a wallet with a subtle gradient from deep blue to teal. The circles are arranged in a triangular layout, each circle containing a small symbol: a stylized "B" for Base, a stylized "B" for BSC, and a stylized "E" for Ethereum. The background is a clean white with a faint geometric pattern of hexagons in light gray. The overall design conveys connectivity, security, and the idea of tracking assets across multiple chains.
